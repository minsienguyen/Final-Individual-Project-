# Final-Individual-Project

Data about song qualities, stream volume, and user interaction have all been amassed by streaming music providers. By using this information, Spotify can curate playlists depending on a user's listening preferences. Is it possible to correlate a song's popularity based on the other measurable characteristics Spotify makes available, given how songs have been measured by the service?

We will examine 12 variables from nearly 33,000 songs in the Spotify dataset obtained with the spotifyr package to see how they interact with one another and whether they have any bearing on popularity. It could make more sense to assess popularity based on each genre's representative data rather than the general statistics as musical genres might have quite varied features.

To find out which factors affect a song's popularity, we will first compare several factors. The data will then be subjected to a multiple linear regression in order to determine which traits are most likely to result in a hit song.
A popularity prediction model can assist songwriters in creating a song using data-driven techniques. Users will gain from being able to find songs based on their favorite qualities and determine if they like songs that are more or less popular.
